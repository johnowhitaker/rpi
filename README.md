# rpi
Raspberry Pi Tinkering - Ignore

## Setup

Raspberry Pi 5, with 2 camera modules (v3)

I used Raspberry Pi Imager to set up default image, set hostname + password, wifi settings and enable SSH.

apt update and upgrade, installed npm, installed codex. We're vibe-coding this - I take no responsibility for the code in this repo, a lot of it will be disposable software :)
